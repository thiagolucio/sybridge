# Frontend Challenge

For this interview, we are providing you with both a challenge prompt and a pre-made solution. During your technical interview, you will be asked to explain and review the provided solution, and then to implement an extension with your interviewers.

## Problem Statement

See [this repo](https://github.com/fast-radius/fe-challenge) for the challenge prompt and instructions to run the api server for this challenge.

## Solution

You will be building off this provided solution in your pairing session. Familiarize yourself with the provided code and be ready to review and extend it. We also ask that you have the development server for both this project and [the associated api](https://github.com/fast-radius/fe-challenge) running locally and available for editing in your text editor of choice prior to the start of your interview.

### Running the code

In one terminal window, pull down the [server code](https://github.com/fast-radius/fe-challenge) and run `yarn server`.

In a different terminal window, pull down these changes and run `yarn start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

_Note_ If you are running a newer version of Node, you may be required to use the legacy version of openssl when starting the development server. If you encounter an `'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'` error, you may run `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider yarn start`. Alternatively, you may elect to install and use an older version of Node. 

Upon successfully starting the development server, you should see something like this:
